		<h1>DUOME</h1>

		<p>
			Duome's Silidisc is a medical device designed to prevent the formation of abdominal adhesions during surgery. Adhesions are scar tissues that form after even the most benign adbominal surgeries (apendectomies, C-sections, etc.) and lead to a lifetime of risk of small bowel obstruction (SBO). SBO causes 67,000 hospitalizations, 2,500 deaths, and $2.15 billion in costs in the United States each year. The process of removing this tissue, called adhesiolysis, often results in more adhesions and a vicious cycle of dangerous surgeries.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Silidisc looks to prevent adhesions by improving the surgical abcess environment to control moisture and temperature. In addition to manufacturing the device itself (CAD, 3D-printed molds, silicone casting, post-processing), we combined manufacturing and electrical components (CAD, laser cutting, circuit-board design, Arduino data collection) to build a test rig and eventually proved efficacy in a porcine model experiment.
