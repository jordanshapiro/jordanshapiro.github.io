		<h1>AEGIS</h1>

		<img src="../trees.jpg">

		<p>
			The Aegis is a Taekwondo board breaking holder. While practicing and instructing Taekwondo classes as a third degree black belt, I recognized two specific problem scenarios for board breaking:
		</p>

		<p>
			The first was that as a student, I was unable to practice breaking outside of my Taekwondo exams because my friends and family did not know how to safely hold a board or, alternatively, were too scared to do so for fear of being kicked. This left me unprepared for important board breaks during my exams.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second problem (perhaps a result of the first) I experienced as an instructor who endured countless smashed fingers when my students missed their intended targets. Especially in high-speed, flying, or performance breaks for which martial artists are expected to use more power, inaccurate strikes or sharp board shards can seriously injure board holders.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Aegis solves for both of these problems by putting distance between the board and the board holder. A shield protects against flying board shards and easily detachable velcro straps hold boards firmly in place.
