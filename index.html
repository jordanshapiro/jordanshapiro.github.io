		<p>
			I am a combiner, an interdisciplinary thinker with a passion for solving complex problems that span seemingly-disparate fields. I recently graduated from the inaugural class of <a href="http://schwarzmanscholars.org/">Schwarzman Scholars</a> at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I graduated from Stanford University, where I earned my master&#39s in <a href="https://msande.stanford.edu/">management science &#38 engineering</a> and my bachelor&#39s in <a href="https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/">bioengineering</a> with a minor in <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/lc/language/courses/minormodernlanguages.html">modern languages</a> (with fluency in Mandarin, Spanish, and Hebrew)(<a href="courses">relevant coursework</a>). At Stanford, I was class president, chief of staff of the student government, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aexwRTDZ8E">convocation student speaker</a>, editor-in-chief of <em><a href="http://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/intersect">Intersect: The Stanford Journal of Science, Technology, and Society</a></em>, and studied technological entrepreneurship as a <a href="http://stvp.stanford.edu/mayfield-fellows-program/">Mayfield Fellow</a>. I am a 3rd degree black belt in taekwondo and am passionate about theater. I merge my diverse interests to study human enhancement and pursue global biotechnological entrepreneurship.
